# CNTLM Proxy Configuration Tool

This project is a CLI for managing proxy configuring on a local dev machine. To configure CTNLM and other dev tools can be troublesome and time consuming.

This tool will be able to dynamically set proxy configuration within CNTLM and other supported tools that have tool specific proxy support.

## Installing

Use the following to be able to install on MacOS via Homebrew:

Running the below command will add the homebrew tap to our repository

```bash
brew tap xUnholy/homebrew-proxy
```

Now you've added our custom tap, you can download with the following command:

```bash
brew install proxy
```

When a new release is available you can update your proxy using by running:

```bash
brew upgrade proxy
```

To upgrade your proxy to the latest stable release use the following command:

```bash
brew upgrade proxy
```

*Note: Should the upgrade fail you may be required to remove the previous binary, the output will print what file to remove*

## Commands

The following is a list of all available commands:

* [Start](#Start)
* [Stop](#Stop)
* [Set](#Set)
* [Unset](#Unset)

### Start

```

```bash
OPTIONS:
   --port PORT, -p PORT  set custom CNTLM PORT (default: 3128)
   --all, -a             set all CNTLM config
```

### Stop

```bash
proxy stop [command options] [arguments...]
```

```bash
OPTIONS:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install:

* [golang](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Running Tests

Use the following steps to execute the test suite:

```go
go test -v  ./...
```

OR

```bash
make test
```

*Note: The test suite will require you to have the supported tools installed and available locally.*

## Build And Package

To be able to package this tool, use one of the following below command:

```go
go build -o proxy .
```

OR

```bash
make build
```

Once you have packaged the application the compiled binary can be executed with the following:
