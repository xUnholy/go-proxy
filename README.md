# CNTLM Proxy Configuration Tool

This project is a CLI for managing proxy configuring on a local dev machine. To configure CTNLM and other dev tools can be troublesome and time consuming. 

This tool will be able to dynamically set proxy configuration within CNTLM and other supported tools that have tool specific proxy support.

## Installing

Use the following to be able to install on MacOS via Homebrew:

1. Running the below command will add the homebrew tap to our repository
